Spiel on interpreted vs compiled.

Pre-processing, compiling, linking.  Simplified model.

# raw_c_notes
gcc options:
-o output_executable

Example:  
`gcc hello.c -o hello`

-c makes it into an object.
`gcc -c hello.c` makes hello.o

-o then lets you put objects into an exe:
`gcc -o hello hello.o

# Printfs:
```#include <stdio.h>```

need \n's for new lines.

Common formats:
%d - print number as integer
%c - print character
%s - print string

MANY other formatting options available (leading zeros, precision, base, etc).  Google search to see them all.


# scanf

# functions & variables:  define before you use.

# argc, argv
